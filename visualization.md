Viewing the Sales Data Visualization

Overview The dashboard provides a clear breakdown of key sales metrics, trends, and geographic insights. Itâ€™s divided into sections that make it easy to analyze and interpret sales performance.

Dashboard Sections

Top Section: Key Metrics Summary

Sales: The total amount of sales.

Profit: Total profit earned, highlighted in blue for easy identification.

Num Cust: The count of unique customers.

Bottom Left: Daily Sales Trends

A line chart tracks how sales fluctuate over time.

Peaks highlight the days with higher sales, while dips indicate slower sales days.

The x-axis represents the dates, and the y-axis shows sales volume.

Bottom Middle: Sales by Product

A bar chart visualizes sales by product category or region.

The darker the bar, the higher the sales for that particular category or region.

The vertical axis lists the categories, and the horizontal axis displays sales figures.

Right Side: Sales by Country

A heatmap illustrates sales distribution across various countries.

Regions with darker shades indicate higher sales volumes.

A legend in the top right corner provides a range of sales figures for reference.
